Part III: Machine Learning Application
In the third part you will concentrate on the shunting-data and you will focus on the identification of the different
shunting phases: parking, shunting or driving. The provided data has no labels attached – therefore you have to
apply unsupervised Machine Learning and use your gained knowledge of the wagon’s usage from Part I and II.
Main objective: Cluster / classify the operational states of the shunting process: those could include whether a
wagon is incoming, parked, shunted, positioned on the target track or outgoing, but it’s up to you to find the most
useful categories for your classification model.
• Analyze the existing database
• Extract relevant features for your clustering model
• Develop a clustering model: you might gain a first overview with features depending on the geofence or
the wagon moving state
• Evaluate the errors, uncertainty and robustness of the models and try to validate the models
• Is your algorithm also transferable on the long-term dataset? Describe the challenges, problems and
critically discuss the quality of the results
• If data-related difficulties or impossibilities arise concerning the task, describe reasons and possible
solutions
